NEAR Units
==========

> Note: It is recommended to use [near-gas](https://crates.io/crates/near-gas) and [near-token](https://crates.io/crates/near-token) crates instead of near-units, as those crates provide strict type wrappers, const constructors, and overall extremely lightweight.

Rust tools to help parse and format NEAR units. For now, this means NEAR tokens and [gas units](https://docs.near.org/docs/concepts/gas).

# Install

```toml
